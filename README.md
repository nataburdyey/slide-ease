## SlideEase

The `SlideEase` project aims to create a responsive image slider using React. The project involves importing data from `data.js`, setting up state values, and creating a container to hold the slides. `Prev` and `Next` buttons are added to navigate through the slides. The main logic involves using the `transform` property to move the slides back and forth. The project also includes implementing an `auto slide` feature using the `setInterval` function, but it was later refactored to leverage the power of `React Slick`.
